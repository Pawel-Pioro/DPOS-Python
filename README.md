My first medium-sized python program that uses tkinter for its GUI. It has different python programs that I also made from tutorials that can be ran from the gui. You can access windows applications by clicking a button, such as Word, Powerpoint, Command Prompt and Python IDLE to name a few. I made this program to develop my tkinter skills and learn a few functions that can interact with the Windows 0S in python. For example, to check if there is an internet connection and run command prompt commands.
